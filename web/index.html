               <h3>Project Background</h3>
               <p>Collision avoidance is one of the most difficult and challenging driving operations for motorists. Avoiding a collision is used as a last resort in a critical situation by braking and/or steering away from the possible accident. Human drivers often fail to safely avoid collisions. Transportation for America reported that 47,700 people were killed and 688,000 others were injured due to traffic accidents in the United States from 2000-2009. Pedestrians being killed in traffic accidents have been one of the highest death tolls in the United States. This is a number that can be drastically reduced if autonomous systems get implemented in today's vehicles.</p><br>
               <h3>Project Description</h3>
               <p>The Automatic Pedestrian Collision Avoidance System (APCAS) is an embedded system for an automotive system designed to work in an autonomous vehicle. The purpose APCAS is to have the vehicle avoid hitting pedestrians with minimal human interactions. The system is designed to not only be safe but enjoyable for the driver and all other passengers inside the vehicle. For this project, our goal to keep the system efficient is to minimize any lost time due to safety maneuvers and to keep the system safe by producing zero collisions.</p><br>
