APCAS-1 (11/08/2011):
Mr. Agnew,

Hello, my name is David Culham and I am the customer liaison for Team
Pedestrian Safety System. We would like to thank you for coming in last
Monday and answering our questions about the project. If we have any more
questions we will be sure to contact you. We look forward to working with
you.

David Agnew - Customer:
Thanks for the note.  Good luck with the project.


APCAS-1 (11/16/2011):
Mr. Agnew,

We have a quick question about the APCA project. The max speed is given for
the scenarios, however, we were wondering how the max speed is determined
in other situations? For example the max speed would be different on the
highway than it would be in a subdivision. Is this something the driver or
system determines? Thank you.


David Agnew - Customer:
Up to the "maximum speed", all pedestrian collisions must be prevented.
The vehicle can go faster, but the specified (0%) collision mitigation is
not required.  It is desired, to be sure, but this project must meet
requirements only up to max speed.
