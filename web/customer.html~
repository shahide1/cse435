			<p><b>Q: When does the system turn on?  When the car is started or does the driver have to turn the system on manually?</b></p>
			<p>A: The system will turn on when the vehicle is put in drive. The driver can enable or disable the system via buttons. The system will shut off when the car is taken out of drive.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: Does the car have to be traveling at a constant speed for the system to work accurately?</b></p>
			<p>A: No, the system should be able to detect a pedestrian whether the car is accelerating, decelerating, or staying at a constant speed.</p></br>
			<p><b>Q: Will the camera be able to detect pedestrians when it is dark outside?</b></p>
			<p>A: Yes, the headlights to the car should provide enough light for the sensors to detect a pedestrian.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: Up to what distance do the cameras detect pedestrians?</b></p>
			<p>A: We will be assuming that 40 meters (estimated) is the extent of this range.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: What happens when the camera lenses are covered in dirt/mud? Should an alert be sent to the driver? Can the system detect if the sensor is working correctly?</b></p>
			<p>A: If the lenses are covered by something, the system will alert the driver that the system is not working correctly. Yes, the system can detect if the sensor is working correctly. The car cannot drive autonomously if the system is not working correctly.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: Will the sensors be able to distinguish between objects? If so, will the system behave differently depending on the object detected?</b></p>
			<p>A: The system will be able to detect the size of the object and use this as a distinction between different objects (e.g. a person vs. a tree). If the object detected is something that you would not want to hit with a car, the system will behave normally (e.g. a trash can or a deer).</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: How stable are the sensors? Will the system be able to detect if the sensors are malfunctioning and how will it be handled if they are?</b></p>
			<p>A: Yes, the system will be able to detect if the sensors are malfunctioning. If they are, the system will shut down, and the car cannot be driven autonomously.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: Where is the camera placed on the vehicle?</b></p>
			<p>A: The cameras will be placed behind the windshield, next to the rear view mirror in order to minimize the obstruction of view for the driver.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: Will the system alert the driver if there is about to be a collision or will the system just brake to avoid the collision and carry on without notifying the driver?</b></p>
			<p>A: The system will not alert the driver in the case of a possible collision. The system will perform itâ€™s braking maneuver and carry on without notifying the driver.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: What does the user interface look like?</b></p>
			<p>A: The user interface will only be an enable/disable button for the system. These buttons will be available either on the steering wheel or on an LED display provided by the cars manufacturer.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: When system is first powered on what default information do you want to display?</b></p>
			<p>A: There is no default information to display to the driver upon starting up the system.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: What kinds of security precautions are being taken?</b></p>
			<p>A: Security precautions are assumed to be taken care of. There are no outside inputs to system. Everything is internal.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: How is the system intended to behave in different weather conditions?</b></p>
			<p>A: The system will function the same, regardless of the weather conditions.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: Are there any legal constraints to be aware of?</b></p>
			<p>A: Some legal constraints to be aware of would be when the car is decelerating (brakes are pressed), the red brake lights on the rear of the car will turn on. Also, the car cannot drive autonomously if the system is not functioning properly.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: What interactions will a user have with a system?</b></p>
			<p>A: The user will be able to enable or disable the system via the UI buttons. Also, if the user hits the brakes or gas pedal, he or she will override the system, disabling the system. Upon disabling the system, the car can no longer drive autonomously.</p><br>

			<p><b>Q: Can the sensors detect multiple pedestrians at the same time?</b></p>
			<p>A: Assume that the sensors can only detect one pedestrian at a time. In reality, these cameras will be able to detect up to 15 pedestrians at a time.</p><br>
